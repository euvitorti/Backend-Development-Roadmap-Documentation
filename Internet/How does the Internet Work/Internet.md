## So, what is Internet?

*The internet is a network of networks.*

It is a connection of all devices around the world, from your smartphone to servers located on the other side of the planet.

## Who created the internet?

**Leonard Kleinrock**

In 1961, he introduced the concept of "packet switching," a fundamental principle of modern internet.

**ARPANET (1969)**

Funded by ARPA (Advanced Research Projects Agency) of the U.S. Department of Defense, it was the first operational network based on packet switching.
Key figures like Vinton Cerf, Robert Kahn, and Larry Roberts played essential roles in developing the protocols and basic structure of ARPANET.

**Tim Berners-Lee**

In 1989, at CERN, Tim Berners-Lee created the World Wide Web (WWW), a platform that popularized the internet by connecting documents and information through hyperlinks.

## Why was the internet created?

**Military Purposes**

During the Cold War, the U.S. sought a decentralized communication network that could withstand attacks, ensuring critical information remained accessible.

**Facilitating Academic Collaboration**

Researchers wanted to share information and computing resources between universities and research institutions more efficiently.

**Technological Innovation and Expansion**

Over time, the goals expanded to connect computers worldwide, simplify global communication, and promote access to information.

## How the Internet Works

The internet connects devices and computer systems through standardized protocols, ensuring reliable and secure information exchange. At its core, a global network of routers directs traffic between devices. Data sent over the internet is divided into small packets, which pass through routers until they reach their destination.

Key protocols include the Internet Protocol (IP), responsible for routing packets, and the Transmission Control Protocol (TCP), which ensures data is delivered reliably and in the correct order. Other essential protocols, such as DNS (to translate domain names into IP addresses), HTTP (for accessing web pages), and SSL/TLS (for secure communication), work together to enable seamless information exchange.

## Basic Concepts and Terminology


To grasp how the internet operates, it's essential to understand key terms:

- Packet: A small unit of data transmitted over the internet.
- Router: A device that directs data packets between networks.
- IP Address: A unique identifier for devices, used to route - data accurately.
- Domain Name: A human-readable address for websites (e.g., google.com).
- DNS (Domain Name System): Converts domain names into IP addresses.
- HTTP/HTTPS: Protocols for transferring data between clients (e.g., browsers) and servers, with HTTPS adding encryption for security.
- SSL/TLS: Protocols that encrypt internet communication, enhancing security.

## The Role of Protocols in the Internet
Protocols are rules that enable effective communication between devices. Core internet protocols include:

- IP (Internet Protocol): Manages the routing of packets to their destination.
- TCP (Transmission Control Protocol): Ensures reliable data delivery and correct packet ordering.
- DNS: Translates human-readable domain names into IP addresses.

These protocols work together to create a seamless communication experience.

## Understanding IP Addresses and Domain Names

Every internet-connected device has an IP address, a unique numerical identifier enabling routing. To simplify user access, domain names provide human-friendly alternatives. For example, instead of typing an IP address like 192.168.0.1, users can enter example.com. The DNS translates domain names into IP addresses, facilitating device connections.

## Introduction to HTTP and HTTPS

HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol) enables data transfer between clients and servers, allowing users to access websites. Its secure counterpart, HTTPS (HTTP Secure), encrypts communication using SSL/TLS protocols. This encryption safeguards data privacy and protects against unauthorized access, making HTTPS a standard for modern web applications.

## Building Applications with TCP/IP

TCP/IP (Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol) forms the backbone of internet applications. TCP ensures reliable data transmission, while IP handles routing. Together, they support the development of robust applications, from simple messaging platforms to sophisticated cloud-based systems.

## Securing Internet Communication with SSL/TLS

Security is paramount in internet communication. SSL (Secure Sockets Layer) and TLS (Transport Layer Security) protocols encrypt data to prevent interception and tampering. These technologies are critical for secure communication in HTTPS, online banking, and file transfers, ensuring safe interactions over the internet.

## Conclusion

The internetâ€™s enduring success lies in its ability to connect devices, exchange data reliably, and adapt to new challenges. Understanding its foundational concepts, protocols, and technologies is vital for anyone in technology or those seeking to appreciate this transformative innovation. As emerging trends shape its future, the internet will remain central to how we live, work, and communicate.
