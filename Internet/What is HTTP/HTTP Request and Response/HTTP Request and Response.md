## What is HTTP/HTTPS and Why Do URLs Start With It?

URLs that start with HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol) or HTTPS (HTTP Secure) indicate the protocol used for communication between the browser and the server.

- **HTTP**: This is a protocol for transferring data in plain text, mainly used for accessing web pages. However, it does not provide security, meaning the data can be intercepted by third parties.

- **HTTPS**: A more secure version of HTTP. It uses encryption through SSL/TLS certificates to protect data during transfer, ensuring that information like passwords and personal details remain secure.

### Are HTTP/HTTPS the Only Protocols Used?

No, *HTTP/HTTPS are the most common protocols for web browsing*, but there are other protocols for specific purposes, such as:

- **FTP (File Transfer Protocol)**: For transferring files.
- **SMTP (Simple Mail Transfer Protocol)**: Used for sending emails.
- **WS/WSS (WebSocket/Secure WebSocket)**: For real-time communication.
- **FTP/SFTP (Secure File Transfer Protocol)**: A secure version of FTP.

Each protocol is chosen based on the type of communication and the required level of security.
