# HTTP - HyperText Transfer Protocol

---

## Protocols

Imagine writing something on paper, like "Raise your hand." The symbols (protocols) such as consonants and vowels form words that convey meaning, and someone reading it will understand the action: "raise" (what?) "the hand" (which is part of the arm).

*Protocols are essentially a set of rules that we agree upon to enable communication. Once these rules are established, meaningful interaction becomes possible.*

**The Internet’s protocols work the same way. By agreeing on a set of rules, two computers can communicate effectively with each other.**

Of course, computers don’t interpret plain text like humans do. They understand only ones and zeros. However, the principle remains the same—it's just information being transmitted between two computers over a network using protocols like HTTP.
